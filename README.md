📊 Tweet #1

"The biggest unlock in AI isn't the models 
getting better.

It's learning that you can put AI in a loop.

Let it:
- Try something
- See the result  
- Adjust
- Try again

Most people use AI like a vending machine.
The winners use it like a teammate."

"I've been using Claude to write code for 6 months.

My #1 tip: Always ask it to explain its 
approach BEFORE writing code.

'How would you solve X?' first.
Then 'Ok, implement that.'

Cuts debugging time by 70%."

"Hot take: Most AI products are just 
ChatGPT wrappers.

But that's fine.

Henry Ford didn't invent the wheel.
He invented the assembly line.

Don't build the AI. Build the workflow."

### Step 3: Add Your Thoughts

```
✅ SELECTED TWEET:
"The biggest unlock in AI isn't the models getting better..."

YOUR RAW THOUGHTS:
"So true! I built an AI tool and initially had one-shot 
prompts. When I added a feedback loop where the AI could 
iterate on its own output, quality improved 10x. It's like 
having a junior dev who learns as they go."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SELECTED TWEET:
"My #1 tip: Always ask it to explain its approach..."

YOUR RAW THOUGHTS:
"Wish I knew this earlier. Wasted hours fixing code because 
I didn't understand the approach. Now I always ask 'walk me 
through your plan first' and spot issues before any code is 
written. Game changer."

### Step 4: Generate Content

```
🤖 GENERATED OPTIONS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION 1: Single Tweet

"I used to treat AI like a calculator:
Input → Output → Done.

Then I discovered loops.

Now my AI tools:
1. Generate something
2. Check if it's good  
3. Self-correct
4. Try again

Quality went up 10x."

OPTION 2: Thread

1/3: "Spent 6 months building with AI.

Biggest lesson: Stop asking AI to be 
perfect on the first try.

Start asking it to iterate."

2/3: "Before writing any code, I now ask Claude:
'Walk me through your approach first'

Catches 80% of issues before a single 
line is written."

3/3: "The model isn't your advantage.
How you use it is."

OPTION 3: Different Angle

"Three AI coding lessons that saved me 100+ hours:

1. Ask for the plan before the code
2. Let it iterate, don't expect perfection
3. Build the workflow, not the AI

Your context = your moat."
